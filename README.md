### Project Overview

 # Data Visualization using Matplotlib

IPL Dataset Analysis

Problem Statement

We want to know as to what happens during an IPL match which raises several questions in our mind with our limited knowledge about the game called cricket on which it is based. This analysis is done to know as which factors led one of the team to win and how does it matter.

About the Dataset :

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional T20 cricket league in India contested during April-May of every year by teams representing Indian cities. It is the most-attended cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all the sports leagues. It has teams with players from around the world and is very competitive and entertaining with a lot of close matches between teams.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I became comfortable using:

Plotting bar plots, stacked bar, pie chart, line charts

Using subplots

Customizing plots by using xlabel, ylabel, xticks, etc. 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Loaded the dataset and created column year which stores the year in which match was played

Plotted the matches won by each team throughout the seasons.

Plotted the total number of matches played by each team across all seasons.

Plotted top 10 bowlers for all the seasons, to identify bowlers with high ratings. 

Plotted venues average score for each innings using line chart to analyze how did different pitches behave and whats the mean score for each stadium.

Plotted out the types of Dismissal and how often they occur using subplots and illustrated with bar and pie chart.

Plotted no. of boundaries including what are the sixes and fours scored across IPL seasons using line chart.

Plotted the average statistics across all seasons.
